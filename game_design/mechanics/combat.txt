 When starting combat, the combatant with higher fleetness may choose to go first or second.
 Combatants then alternate turns.
 On the player's turn, they can choose from the following actions.
  "[slot one equipped weapon]"
    This attacks with the weapon that the player has equipped in their first slot
  "[slot two equipped weapon]"
     This arracks with the weapon that the player has equipped in their second slot
  "[slot one equipped magic]"
      This performs the magic that the player has equipped in their first slot.
  "[slot two equipped magic]"
    This performs the magic that the player had equipped in their first slot.
  "Item"
    This takes them to their item menu where they can use an item.
  "Flee"
    This attempts to flee.
The player may take one action per turn.

Whether an attack with a weapon hits is calculated with the formula c = ap * r1 / fw where:
  c is the chance that the attack will hit (values over 1 always hit)
  ap is the player's accuracy
  fe is the enemy's fleetness
  r1 is a random number ranging from 0.95 to 1.05

How much damage an attack with a weapon does is calculated by the formula p = floor(sp * pw * r2 / de) where:
  p is the damage dealt
  sp is the player's strength
  pw is the weapon's power
  r2 is a random number ranging from 0.85 to 1.15

Each magic works differently but all use the player's magic stat and the enemy's resistance stat.

Whether a player can escape combat is calculated by c = fp / fe - 0.25 where:
  c is the chance that the player will escape
  fp is the player's fleetness
  fe is the enemy's fleetness
